# Estimators
Prompt:
***A certain species of bird is historically known to have a Normally distributed flight speed with 
a mean of 40 km/hr and a standard deviation of 3 km/hr. You would like to estimate the true 
variance of the flight speed using a sample of birds. 
Find the “best” estimator of true population variance from the following three estimators:
(the estimators are given on my website)***

I have written R code and analyzed this to determine the best estimator for this certain species of bird.
